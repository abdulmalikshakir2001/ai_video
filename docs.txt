1) i comment the db:setup cmd in Docker.railway file.
2)also remove "subtitleStyle"  parameter from createAssFile() in generateSubtitle.ts  becuase right now we are using static value and the subtitleStyle object will be pass from frontend.

3)python-magic-bin==0.4.14   remove  this package from requirement.txt file  becuase it is not supported in linux environment (for deployment purpose)  in master branch



TODO:
   1) make the createAssFile options dynamic (pass from front end)
   2) youtube links video upload not working


NOTE :  only merge specific comment from feature branch to master branch
