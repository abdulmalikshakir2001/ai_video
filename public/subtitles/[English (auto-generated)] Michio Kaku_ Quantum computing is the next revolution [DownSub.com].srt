1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,700
we all know that digital computers

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,640
change virtually every aspect of our

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,080
life

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,300
well the arrival of quantum computers

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
could be even more historic than that

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,480
we're now on the initial stages of the

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,359
next Revolution we're talking about a

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,539
new generation of computers the ultimate

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,939
computer a computer that computes an

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,279
atoms the ultimate constituents of

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,039
matter itself

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,260
the question is who's involved in this

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,780
race to perfect quantum computers and

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,600
the answer is everyone

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,239
all the big players are part of this

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,579
race because if they're not Silicon

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,379
Valley could become the next Rust Belt

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,820
also anyone who's interested in security

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,680
is interested in the quantum computers

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,879
they can crack almost any code that is

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,940
based on digital technology that's why

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,899
the FBI the CIA and all national

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
governments are following this very

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,119
closely

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,420
Quantic computers will change everything

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,900
the economy how we solve problems the

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,000
way we interact with the universe you

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,320
name it quantum computers will be there

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,659
I'm Dr Michio okaku professor of

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,159
theoretical physics at the City

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,500
University of New York and author of

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,680
quantum Supremacy about the rise of

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,200
quantum computers

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,340
[Music]

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,020
you see computers have gone through

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,479
three basic stages

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,079
stage one was the analog computer so two

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,900
thousand years ago there was a shipwreck

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,500
and in the boat that sank was a device

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,899
and when you brushed away the dirt and

41
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,079
debris you begin to realize that it was

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,659
a machine a machine of incredible

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,960
complexity it was in fact the world's

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,079
first analog computer and it was

45
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,199
designed to map the motion of the Moon

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,819
the sun and the planets to simulate the

47
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,120
universe but as we primitive peoples

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,819
became more prosperous we had to count

49
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,580
things count how many cows you had count

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,340
how much profit you made

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,980
analog computers could be based on

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,819
sticks bones whatever it took to count

53
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,540
so this went on for thousands of years

54
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,099
until finally we reached the work of

55
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,599
Charles Babbage

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,160
he creates the ultimate analog computer

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,500
with hundreds of gears and levers and

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,980
pulleys and by turning the crank you

59
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,200
could then calculate longitude latitude

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,780
you can calculate interest rates it was

61
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,120
very valuable to have an instrument like

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
that for the banking industry for

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,220
Commerce

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,440
[Music]

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,620
then World War II comes along babbage's

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,900
machine is simply too primitive to break

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,680
the German code so the job was given to

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,319
mathematicians like Alan Turing

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,560
Alan Turing was the one who codified a

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,319
lot of the laws of computation into what

71
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,080
is called a turing machine and of course

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
is digital

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,700
now the digital Revolution is based on

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,280
transistors it operates on zeros and

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
ones zeros and ones at the speed of

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,300
electricity every digital computer is a

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
turning machine

78
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,700
The Next Step Beyond digital computers

79
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,459
is the Quantum era Richard Feynman was

80
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,440
one of the founders of quantum

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,400
electrodynamics but also a Visionary and

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,860
he asked himself a simple question how

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,159
small can you make a transistor and he

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,340
realized that the ultimate transistor is

85
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,940
an atom one atom that could control the

86
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,299
flow of electricity not just on or off

87
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,260
but everything in between we have to go

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,599
to quantum computers

89
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,420
computers that compute on atoms rather

90
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,680
than on transistors

91
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,800
transistors are based on zeros and one

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,000
zeros and one reality is not reality is

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,180
based on electrons and particles and

94
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,820
these particles in turn act like waves

95
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,100
so you have to have a new set of

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,300
mathematics to discuss the waves that

97
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,360
make up a molecule and that's where

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
quantum computers come in

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
they're based on electrons and these

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,560
electrons how come they have so much

101
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,960
computational power because they could

102
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,380
be in two places at the same time that's

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,919
what gives quantum computers their power

104
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,540
they compute

105
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,840
on not just one universe but an infinite

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,340
number of parallel universes

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,020
at the fundamental level quantum

108
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,320
mechanics can be reduced down to a cat

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
Schrodinger's cat

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,820
let's take a box

111
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,940
in the Box you put a cat and the

112
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,240
question is is the cat dead or alive

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,539
well until you open the box you don't

114
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,440
know

115
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,180
it is alive and dead simultaneously it's

116
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,699
in a superposition of two states

117
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,880
in other words the universe has split in

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
half

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,360
in one half the cat is alive in the

120
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,699
other Universe the cat is Dead That's

121
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,520
the basis of the quantum theory that

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,639
until you make a measurement the cat can

123
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,639
exist in both States simultaneously in

124
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,199
fact in any number of states

125
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,060
simultaneously

126
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,300
the cat could be Dead Alive playing

127
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,960
jumping sideways sick any number of

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,780
states now why am I mentioning this

129
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,720
because this summarizes the power of

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,280
quantum computers

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,120
quantum computers compute unparalleled

132
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,380
universes

133
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,860
that's why they are so powerful

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,699
[Music]

135
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,620
so how much faster is a quantum computer

136
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,539
over a digital computer in principle

137
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,160
infinitely faster

138
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,340
when we talk about digital computers we

139
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,280
can measure their power in terms of bits

140
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,180
for example spin up spin down zeros and

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,500
one would constitute one bit for a large

142
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,780
digital computer we're not talking about

143
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,900
billions of bits that are modeled by

144
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
transistors

145
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,220
except now quantum computers talk not

146
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,160
just about spin up or spin down but

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,340
everything in between that's called a

148
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,580
qubit one qubit represents all the

149
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,300
possibilities of an object spinning

150
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,479
between up and down

151
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,699
thousands of qubits can now be modeled

152
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,580
with the latest generation of quantum

153
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,880
computers eventually we hope to hit a

154
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
million

155
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,539
and so we're talking about exceeding the

156
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,240
power of ordinary digital computers

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,720
that's called Quantum Supremacy it is

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,319
the point at which a quantum computer

159
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
can outrace and outperform a digital

160
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
computer on a certain task

161
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,259
we passed that several years ago but we

162
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,000
want a machine that could exceed the

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,060
power of any digital computer we're not

164
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,099
there yet but we're very close to it

165
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,460
the number one problem facing quantum

166
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,800
computers is the question of the

167
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
coherence

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,699
everything is based on particles like

169
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,280
electrons and electrons have waves

170
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,199
associated with them

171
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,479
when these waves are vibrating in unison

172
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,759
it's called coherence

173
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,460
and then you can do calculations of a

174
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,800
quantum mechanical nature but if you

175
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,539
fall out of coherence

176
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,580
then everything vibrates at a different

177
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,599
frequency and what is that called noise

178
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,780
you have to reduce the temperature down

179
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,299
to near absolute zero

180
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,179
so everything is pretty much vibrating

181
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,979
slowly in unison that's difficult

182
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,559
now nature solves this problem

183
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,720
it is the basis of all life on the earth

184
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,060
photosynthesis for example is a quantum

185
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,540
mechanical process Mother Nature

186
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,320
can create coherence at room temperature

187
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,200
amazing a flower can do calculations

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,480
that are most advanced Quantum a

189
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,160
computer cannot

190
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
Mother Nature is still smarter than us

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,200
when it comes to the quantum theory

192
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,680
so let's face it there are hurdles

193
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,660
affecting the growth of quantum

194
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,040
computers but they pale in comparison to

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,040
the benefits that may be Unleashed by

196
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,200
quantum computers we're talking about

197
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
opening the floodgates

198
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,839
take a look for example of food supply

199
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,060
the Green Revolution that allows us to

200
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,399
feed the population of the world is

201
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,920
slowly coming to an end we're trying to

202
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
use quantum computers to unlock the

203
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,660
secret of how to make fertilizer from

204
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,959
nitrogen take a look at energy

205
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,420
quantum computers may be able to create

206
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,779
fusion power by stabilizing the super

207
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,279
hot hydrogen inside a fusion reactor and

208
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,459
take a look at medicine you realize that

209
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,279
life is based on molecules molecules

210
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,339
that can create Alzheimer's disease

211
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,200
Parkinson's disease cancer

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,440
these diseases are beyond the reach of

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,200
digital computers but hey this is what

214
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,540
quantum computers do we'll be able to

215
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,080
model diseases at the molecular level

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,600
and that's why we hope to cure the

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
incurable using quantum computers we're

218
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,080
talking about turning medicine upside

219
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,380
down

220
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,720
my personal hope for quantum computers

221
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
is that we'll be able to create a theory

222
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,300
of the entire universe the theory that

223
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,700
eluded Einstein the theory that would

224
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,579
explain black holes and supernovas and

225
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,820
Galactic Evolution but the equations are

226
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,420
so complex that no one no one has been

227
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,240
able to solve them perhaps they'll be

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
solved in the memory of a quantum

229
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,740
computer

230
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,740
foreign

231
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,260
to learn even more from the world's

232
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,720
biggest thinkers get big think Plus for

233
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,140
your business
