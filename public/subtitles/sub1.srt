00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,700
we all know that digital computers

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,640
change virtually every aspect of our

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,080
life

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,300
well the arrival of quantum computers

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
could be even more historic than that

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,480
we're now on the initial stages of the

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,359
next Revolution we're talking about a

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,539
new generation of computers the ultimate

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,939
computer a computer that computes an

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,279
atoms the ultimate constituents of

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,039
matter itself

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,260
the question is who's involved in this

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,780
race to perfect quantum computers and
